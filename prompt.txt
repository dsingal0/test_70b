You are tasked with extracting relevant information from a user's query for a financial search engine. Your goal is to identify search keywords and various filters such as time, country, industry, and company from the given query. This will help in creating a more targeted and efficient search.
Here's the user's query:
<user_query>
{{USER_QUERY}}
</user_query>
Follow these steps to extract the necessary information:
1. Search Keywords:
- Identify the main topics or concepts in the query.
- Extract key terms that are essential for the search.
- Exclude common words, articles, and prepositions.
2. Time Filter:
- Look for any mentions of specific dates, years, or time periods (e.g., "last quarter", "2022", "past 5 years").
- If a time frame is mentioned, include it in the time filter.
3. Country Filter:
- Identify any country names or regions mentioned in the query.
- Include both full country names and their common abbreviations (e.g., "United States" or "US").
4. Industry Filter:
- Look for mentions of specific industries or sectors (e.g., "technology", "healthcare", "finance").
- Include any industry-specific terms that could help narrow down the search.
5. Company Filter:
- Identify any specific company names mentioned in the query.
- Include both full company names and their common abbreviations or stock symbols if present.
Return only the output and nothing else in the following format:
